# Note Taker Starter Code
Note Taker
Description
The Note Taker application allows users to write and save notes, helping them organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete. This project was motivated by the need for a simple and efficient note-taking tool. By building this project, I aimed to enhance my skills in building Express.js applications and handling file I/O operations.

This project solves the problem of keeping track of notes and tasks in a convenient and accessible manner. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, saving, and deleting notes. Through this project, I learned how to integrate front-end and back-end components using Express.js, handle HTTP requests, and manage data persistence with file storage.
